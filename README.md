from Telegram.

## Bugs and TODO

- Document naming is messed up and not consistent on Telegram, have to find a way to always send same names

PRs are welcome :)


## Installation

- Make a supergroup (enable message history for new members) with topics enabled
- Add your bot in the group, make it an admin with permissions to `Manage topics`
- Install `git`, `gcc` and `golang`, `ffmpeg` , `imagemagick` (optional), on your system
- Clone this repository anywhere and navigate to the cloned directory
- Run `go build`
- Copy `sample_config.yaml` to `config.yaml` and fill the values, there are comments to help you.
- Execute the binary by running `./watgbridge`
- On first run, it will show QR code for logging into WhatsApp that can by scanned by the WhatsApp app in `Linked devices`
- It is recommended to restart the bot after every few hours becuase WhatsApp likes to disconnect a lot. So a sample Systemd service file has been provided (`watgbridge.service.sample`). Edit the `User` and `ExecStart` according to your setup:
    - If you do not have local bot API server, remove `tgbotapi.service` from the `After` key in `Unit` section.
    - This service file will restart the bot every 24 hours
